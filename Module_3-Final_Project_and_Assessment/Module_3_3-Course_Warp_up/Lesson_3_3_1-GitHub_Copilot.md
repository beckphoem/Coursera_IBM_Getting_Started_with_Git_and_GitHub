# Features of GitHub Copilot

Autocompletion:
- Functions 
- Classes
- Code structures

Let's look at the features of GitHub Copilot. The first one is code auto-completion. Github Copilot Suggests whole lines or blocks of code based on the context of the code you are currently working on. It can complete entire functions classes, or other code structure. 

Real-time suggestions:
- Repetitive or standard code 

GitHub Copilot offers real-time suggestions as you code, making the development process smoother. You can save time on writing repetitive or standard code.

Contextual suggestions:
- Function names
- Variable names
- Algorithms 

GitHub Copilot generates suggestions based on the code context including function names, variable names, and even algorithm implementation. 

For xample, while coding in a Python project, when you start writing a for loop and declare a variable such as total underscore, quantity, GitHub Copilot can provide suggestions for the loop structure and calculations. 

Support for programming languages :
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C++

It supports a wide range of programming languages and it designed to provide you assistance across various popular languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, and many more. 

Integration with IDEs:
- Pycharm 

GitHub Copilot integrates with various popular code editors and integrated development environments or IDs such as Pycharm. This makes it easy for you to access it from various development environments.

Learning from shared knowledge:
- Public code
- Documents
- Educational resources 

 GitHub Copilot keeps learning from the shared knowledge in public code, ducuments, and educational resources. It uses this knowledge to make better suggestions over time.

# Writing code using Copilot suggestions 

You will begin writing code as you normally would. You will begin writing code as you normally would. 
GitHub Copilot will start to provide suggestions and autocompletion based on the context of your code. 

For example, when you start writing a function in your code, GitHub Copilot generates funciton bodies.
Another example is where GitHub Copilot offers auto-completion suggestions for variable names when you begin declaring a new variable.
To accept a suggestion, you can use the tab key or select the suggestion.

# Reviewing and testing 

After generating or editing the code, you will review it to ensure it aligns with your project's requirements and best coding practices.
You will test the code to verify that it functions as expected.

# Debugging

If any problems come up, you will need to debug the code in the same way you would with any other code.

 GitHub Copilot does not help you with debugging.
 So it's important to perform this step to make sure the code works properly.

# Commiting the changes

 After you are satisfied with the code, you can commit the changes to your version control system such as Git, and push the changes to the remote repository.

 Make sure you document any code changes or additions with comments and explanations so that other developers can easily comprehend the code.

# Using GitHub Copilot effectively

 GitHub Copilot helps you work faster, especially with repetitive or standard code segments.
 However, remember that it is just a tool to assist you and must not be relied upon for writing critical or complex code. 
 You should use it wisely,review suggestions, and make sure the code is good, secure, and follows best practices.
